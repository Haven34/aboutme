        <p>Hello everybody it's nice to be here. I live in Blackfoot, Idaho. I love sports, reading, 
           drawing, and just spending time outside. I am the second of four kids and I am really interested in coding which 
            is probably most of the reasons we are here right now. Hope my webpage is up to par.</p>  
            <p>Right now I am working towards my Computer Science Major though I am a freshman
               so I have a long way to go. So far though it has been fun learning about all this
               coding stuff and I can't wait to start using it for a lot of things.</p>
            <p>I love BYU-I so much because it is not only such a great school and was just ranked
               20th in the U.S., it also has a lot of gospel related parts embeded into the classes
               and framework. I am part of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and this day
               and age, you don't usually get a lot of support in grade school and high school but 
               BYU is just so supportive and and it just feels like a friend</p>
               <p>I have been a member of the church all my life and it is what makes me, me. Without
                  the church, I would most likely be ashamed of myself and have a totally different outlook
                  on life. The church has helped me build friendships, find faith, and build my testimonies
                  that have gotten me through the hard parts of my life.</p>
